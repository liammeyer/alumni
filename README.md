# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Additional notes/ideas for improvement:

Ask: Are you a student or alumni
    If student then just continue to website and select department/major
    If alumni then ask if they've made a profile
        If so - let them log in
        If not - make username/password and quick profile with personal info

    Personal info: Department, major n' minor, clubs, year graduated, jobs (tasks, timeline), hobbies



    Students use UND login to get in, alumni make an account, alumni can see other profiles but not contact info
    Only students can see contact info which is why they will need UND login from database to get in



Clicking on logo image is hyperlinked to UND website
Clicking on the either of words "Alumni" or "Addition" hyperlinks to landing page
Select department in dropdown THEN select major in dropdown below that? Only selecting department has all major profiles

Research
    Node.js / Express setup for POST request (containing image(s) and public personal info)
    Cloud storage like Amazon S3
    Create routes to serve the uploaded images and text back to the React app for display
    Fetch the data (image URLs and text) when needed and display them in your React components
